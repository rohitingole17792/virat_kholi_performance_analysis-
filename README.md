# Virat_Kohli_Performance_analysis-

### In this project, I utilized Python and powerful libraries like NumPy and Pandas for data analysis, enabling me to process and extract meaningful insights from the performance data. Additionally, I created a dynamic dashboard in Power BI to visually represent the findings, offering interactive visualizations and easy-to-understand metrics of Virat Kohli's performance. To effectively communicate the results, I also prepared a PowerPoint presentation (PPT), summarizing the key insights, trends, and conclusions from the analysis. This combination of tools allowed me to present a comprehensive, data-driven performance analysis in an engaging and accessible format.
